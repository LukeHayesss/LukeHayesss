# Hey! A little about me...

* ❤️ I'm currently putting the finishing touches on my personal project, [FOODZY](https://github.com/LukeHayesss/final-project-foodzy). It's an awesome app where users can filter through recipes based on dietary preferences or health conditions.

* 🌄 Recent graduate from the Concordia Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp diploma program.

* 😄 Looking for full or part-time employment in Frontend Web Development.

* 🌠 Who am I? I've been a Chef and Business Owner for most of my professional life, and I'm <i>excited</i> to transition to the world of coding.

* 💻 I love awesome code, disco, rnb, and spicy food.
